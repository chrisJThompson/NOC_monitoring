# NOC_monitoring

This is a play area project. Tired of monitoring tools that do not quite do what I want, and wanting to learn a new language I decided to attempt to write my own in golang. 

The project itself is to have a tool that acts as a NOC would, initially just alerting into a real NOC, later on having the ability to troubleshoot an issue, raise an incident in ServiceNow, raise an alert through alerting systems and maybe even fix the issue if a runbook is already in place and ready for automation.

The idea is to do the following:

website monitoring
third party monitoring through APIs
Servicenow monitoring for
vcenter monitoring
server monitoring


later on, will add a web server that displays page(s) linked to the outage on a loop, either grafana pages that teams have built, or third party status pages.

admit, not sure how to do all this, but thats the fun right?
